```jsx
// 9 toasts will be visible instead of the default, which is 3.
<Toaster expand visibleToasts={9} />
```

Changes the place where all toasts will be rendered.

```jsx
// Available positions:
// top-left, top-center, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-center, bottom-right
<Toaster position="top-center" />
```

### Styling all toasts

You can customzie all toasts at once with `toastOptions` prop. These options witll act as the default for all toasts.

```jsx
<Toaster
  toastOptions={{
    style: { background: 'red' },
    className: 'my-toast',
  }}
/>
```

### dir

Changes the directionality of the toast's text.

<Toaster dir="rtl" />
```
